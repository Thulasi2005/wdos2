        <p id="p1">The sea turtle is one of the most fascinating creatures that Sri Lanka is home to since it is one of the world's many endangered species. Sea turtle hatcheries on Sri Lanka's western coast frequently see a sizable number of them. The sea turtles go to the hatcheries during their maturing cycle by swimming through the vast Indian Ocean. The Galle Sea Turtle Hatchery in Sri Lanka was founded around 40 years ago to preserve these regular visits, and more hatcheries were eventually constructed. </p><br>
        <p id="p2">Olive Ridley, Green, Hawksbill, Loggerhead, and Leatherhead sea turtles are among the five types that are gradually discovered here at the sea turtle hatchery in Sri Lanka. A separate tank set out specifically for their safety houses all of the wounded sea turtles. Every employee at the Sri Lanka Hatcheries has received basic training on how to aid any sea turtles who are in dire need of medical attention or who are pregnant.</p><br>
        <p id="p3">Two major turtle hatcheries are shown below.</p>

The institution was established in 1981 and is located in the South Western Australian coastal town of Kosgoda. Additionally, all five species of turtles that visit Sri Lanka lay their eggs at Kosgoda. Contrary to many other island-area hatcheries, where only some of the species are found on the beaches, this is not the case.</p><br><br>

Numerous endangered turtle species, such the Olive Ridley and Leatherback turtles, have an attractive nesting place on our island's lovely golden sands. The project's goal is to protect the eggs from predators and other hazards while preserving them. To prevent the extinction of the turtles, the Sri Lankans established the Turtle Hatchery. </p><br><br>

            <img id="img4" src="images/otherhatcheris_tips.jpg" alt="tips" width="300" height="300"><br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>-Take part in their turtle conservation tour to learn more about marine turtles. Every visitor to the Sea Turtle Hatchery of Sri Lanka is given access to an informative tour during which they may learn more about the evolution of sea turtles as well as the processes involved in their hatching and protection.<br><br></li>
                    <li>-Female Sea turtles like to lay their eggs in quiet, dark areas, so as a kind tourist, be careful not to turn on the spotlights on your DSLRs or cellphones.<br><br></li>
                    <li>-Avoid attempting to feed any of the wildlife because doing so might leave them vulnerable to unforeseen illnesses and diseases.<br><br></li>
                    <li>-Be careful not to leave any plastic bags lying around when you visit the hatchery. The worst part is that the sea turtles could believe their carry-on luggage to be food, leading to confusion.<br><br></li>
                    <li>-Remain a respectable distance away from these sea turtles' breeding locations.<br><br></li>
