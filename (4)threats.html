                    <p id="p1">The primary natural dangers to sea turtles come from predators. Wild dogs. Jackals, wild boars, mongooses, water and land monitors, as well as others. On nesting beaches, certain ant and crab species might be thought of as natural predators of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings (Photo no. 31). Hatchlings in the water are preyed upon by killer whales, orca whales, sharks, other reef fish, and seabirds. Sometimes severe weather events like hurricanes, tornadoes, draughts, and the El Nino phenomena can harm turtle eggs that have already been laid.</p><br>
                    <p id="p2">In-situ conservation:<br>
                        The term "in-situ conservation" refers to conservation practises that are closest to nature. Sea turtles can thrive through natural selection if their native environments are preserved. Natural conditions are maintained with a focus on minimising human effect. Both the hatchling turtle and the nesting mother turtle exhibit extremely ecologically sensitive habits.</p><br>

                    <p id="p4">Many marine turtles are killed by marine pollution because they mistake floating plastic bags for jellyfish, which causes them to starve to death. Leatherback turtles, who consume jellyfish, are particularly vulnerable to this problem. In addition, a condition known as ''Fibropapilloma'' that resembles a tumour is a major killer of marine turtles. This illness is thought to be brought on by marine contaminants. Fibropapilloma is not, however, currently present in Sri Lanka's turtle populations.

                        The Fund's mission is to develop a sense of responsibility for the island's extraordinary beauty and natural value while assisting current environmental and conservation activities. The empowerment of neighbourhood communities, supported by investments in the surrounding environment, is the cornerstone of our purpose.

                    <p id="p7">To supply raw materials for the "tortoise shell" trade, the severely endangered Hawksbill turtle is murdered all over the world for its stunning shell or carapace. The turtle finally perishes when the scutes are removed from its shell. There are now synthetic fibres with colours and patterns that resemble tortoiseshell dies. For the benefit of hawksbill turtles, synthetic fibres with comparable colour patterns can now be used in place of tortoiseshell raw materials.

                    <p id="p8">Ex-situ conservation:<br>
                        Ex-situ conservation of turtles refers to the preservation of turtles outside of their natural habitat. Sea turtle ex situ conservation is carried out via turtle hatcheries. Owners of hatcheries purchase eggs from egg collectors and rebury them in a safe location. Baby hatchlings then emerge after the eggs have incubated and hatched there. These hatchlings are then gathered, held in aquariums for a short time, and then released.
